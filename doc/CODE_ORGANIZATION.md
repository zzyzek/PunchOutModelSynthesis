Code Organization
===

This document is a rough guide to how the code is organized.

Introduction
---

This is a reference implementation for Punch Out Model Synthesis (POMS) and is
a research tool to help with exploration of different ideas relating to
Constraint Based Tiling Generation (CBTG) algorithms with a focus on introspection,
debugging and visualization.
As such, the focus has been on exploration of ideas rather than keeping tidy code.
There are many different ideas sprinkled throughout the code base, some more
focused on the core algorithm than others.

For an overview of the algorithm, see the paper ([here](https://zzyzek.github.io/PunchOutModelSynthesisPaper/),
[here](https://github.com/zzyzek/PunchOutModelSynthesis), [and here](https://github.com/zzyzek/PunchOutModelSynthesis-Paper)).

The best place to start from a usability perspective is to look at the `[runs](https://github.com/zzyzek/PunchOutModelSynthesis/tree/main/runs)` directory, as that has example usage
for a variety of tilesets.
